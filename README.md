# UnixTerminal C

This repo is an implementation of basic command execution such as is performed by any unix shell. The parsing of the command line is the key to this assignment, and can execute any command. The code allows for modification of commands and overwriting functions in order to simplify the user process.

The following features are currently available:

* Command Parsing
* Error Handling
* Directory and File system
* Pointers and Pipelines
* I/O Redirection
* Connectives ';', '&&', and '||'

To run, either run fsh-Compiled or the Makefile itself which will compile everything and allow for personal modification to add or remove features.
